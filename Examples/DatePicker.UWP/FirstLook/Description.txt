RadDatePicker is an input control that consists of two parts - an inline button-like part and a popup (or Selector) part. When the inline part is tapped the popup part is opended and three lists are displayed, allowing for picking the Day, the Month and the Year components of a valid Date. In order to confirm the selection in the popup part, either the OK button should be tapped or the 'Enter' key should be pressed. The example demonstrates a simple usage of RadDatePicker and how it can be used to allow the user to select valid Time.
