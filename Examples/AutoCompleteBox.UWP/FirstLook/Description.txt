This example shows the RadAutoCompleteBox control. The search box is bound to a remote service and will request data as you type.

Type a part of a movie name (e.g. "Avenger") to see all matching titles that are in theaters now. Click on a result to see more information about the movie.

In addition to supporting remote data, the RadAutoCompleteBox allows item templates for customizing the results display, and text match highlighting for the current input.
