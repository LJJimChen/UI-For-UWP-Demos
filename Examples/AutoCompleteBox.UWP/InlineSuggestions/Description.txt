By default RadAutoCompleteBox visualizes the list of suggestions in a drop-down control. However, in some scenarios it is useful to visualize the results inline in the page content instead, so RadAutoCompleteBox enables this scenario by exposing a public enumerable FilteredItems property that contains the list of currently filtered suggestions to bind to (the control also allows the user to disable the drop-down visualization through the DropDownPlacement property).
