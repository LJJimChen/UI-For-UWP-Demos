RadChart for Windows Universal has been designed from the ground up to meet the 'fast and fluid' requirement for a Windows Universal application. Its flexible API allows various different scenarios to be achieved with ease both in XAML and through code. The example simulates a dashboard that visualizes some statistical data. The buttons on the left change the data and the series. The top chart is interactive while the two charts at the bottom are static.
