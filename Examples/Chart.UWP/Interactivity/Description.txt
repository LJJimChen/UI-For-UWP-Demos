The example demonstrates the Pan and Zoom behavior available for RadChart. You may pan along the X-axis using Pan gesture to see data distribution for the next years. Using double-tap gesture will reset the zoom to its default value (1, 1). Using a Hold gesture will display the information about the closest to the touch location data point and Pinch gesture  to zoom-in and out.
