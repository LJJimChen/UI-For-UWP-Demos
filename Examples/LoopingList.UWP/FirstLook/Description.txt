RadLoopingList can scroll a logical range of items infinitely. Its well thought virtualizing model provides unmatched performance and smooth scrolling, based entirely on render transformations rather than layout passes.
Using both UI and Data virtualization the control is capable of displaying practically any virtual number of items. Content is updated dynamically and data items are reused as content placeholders.

The control may be used in many different scenarios - such as a "wheel" within a Date/Time selector instance. It may even serve as a super-fast list control for items with fixed height and light data templates.

The example demonstrates how RadLoopingList may be used to simulate a reel within something like a "slot machine". Press the "Spin" button to start scrolling or the "Stop" button to cancel existing scrolling.
