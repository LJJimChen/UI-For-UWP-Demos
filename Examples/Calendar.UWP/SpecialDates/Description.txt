This example demonstrates how you can use RadCalendar to add special dates in the calendar and style them differently e.g. you can use the special dates to add appointments for given dates. Note that in general RadCalendar supports special slots on all calendar view levels (i.e. not only in Month view). This example is configured to allow single cell selection and selecting a special date cell, displays the available calendar events for this date in the area on the right. Also, the Today button at the bottom of the calendar control is configured to move the current view to today's view with sliding animation.
