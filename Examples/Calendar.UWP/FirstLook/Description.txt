RadCalendar for Windows Universal has been designed from the ground up to meet the 'fast and fluid' requirement for a Windows Universal application. Its flexible API allows various scenarios to be achieved with ease both in XAML and through code. This example simulates checkin/checkout scenario for a hotel booking application. The calendars are configured to allow single selection and once you have performed the selection in both calendars, the chosen date range is visually marked thanks to the provided support for custom (special) day slots. Also, the calendar display range is restricted to not allow navigation beyond today's date in the past - the cells beyond this threshold are marked as blackout (disabled).
