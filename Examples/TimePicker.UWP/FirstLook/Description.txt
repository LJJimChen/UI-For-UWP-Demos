RadTimePicker is an input control that consists of two parts - an inline button-like part and a popup (or Selector) part. When the inline part is tapped the popup part is opended and three lists are displayed, allowing for picking the hour, minute and the AM/PM designator. In order to confirm the selection in the popup part, either the OK button should be tapped or the 'Enter' key should be pressed. The example demonstrates a simple usage of RadTimePicker and how it can be used to allow the user to select valid Time.
